# &= Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# |= Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
# ^= Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# >>= Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
# <<= Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
